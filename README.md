# MLoodify
## 2022 IEEE Machine Learning Team Project
We want some music right now, but itâ€™s a hassle to find a song that fits our current mood. What if we could just tell the computer program how we felt and let the program choose songs for us? MLoodify is a web application that enables users to queue a list of songs from their Spotify playlists based on the mood they choose.

We trained and tested the machine learning models on the MuSe Dataset from Kaggle.
